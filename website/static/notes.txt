javascript, images, css (things that don't change) go in the static folder

can then be loaded into html with (in the body tag):

<script
    type="text/javascript"
    src="{{url_for('static', filename="index.js)}}"
></script>

url_for loads the url for the static folder
{{}} means we'll write a python expression
